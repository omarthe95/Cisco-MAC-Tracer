# Cisco MAC Tracer
Trace a host MAC address through Cisco access switches



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.



### Prerequisites:

* Linux OS (Recommended for Ubuntu 18.04)
* Python >=3.5 (pre-installed)
```
python3 --version
```

     
* SSH enabled and tested (connectivity)
```
ssh cisco@192.168.1.10
```

     
     
### Installing:

* Download the repository into a directory
```
git clone https://github.com/omarthe95/Cisco-MAC-Tracer.git
```

* Run setup.sh
```
bash setup.sh
```

* Edit L3 Cisco Routers (Gateway devices) **IPaddress_Routers.txt** file with your own management IP address, each device IP per line
```
nano IPaddress_Routers.txt
```

* Edit L2 Cisco Switches **IPaddress_Switches.txt** file with your own management IP address, each device IP per line
```
nano IPaddress_Switches.txt
```
* You may change the access credentials inside each python script individually, because the default access credentials into network devices is **cisco:Cisco123**




## Running the Scripts

We will start with each script with GIF to see it function



### Sequential.py

Entering each device **(one-by-one)** take so much time  

```
python3 Sequential.py
```

### MultiThreading.py

But executing it with *Threads* for each **independently** device of one another makes it faster

```
python3 MultiThreading.py
```
<img src="https://github.com/omarthe95/Resources/blob/master/MultiThreading.gif">

### Asyncio_Netdev.py

Concurrent the code with Asyncio that runs in a single thread will go beyond faster

```
python3 Asyncio_Netdev.py
```
<img src="https://github.com/omarthe95/Resources/blob/master/NetDev.gif">

## MultiThreading vs. Asynchronous
